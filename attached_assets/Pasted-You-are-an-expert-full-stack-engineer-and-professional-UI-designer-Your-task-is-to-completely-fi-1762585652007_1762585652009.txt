You are an expert full-stack engineer and professional UI designer.

Your task is to completely fix and redesign my Replit project (multiagentcounselling-1) so that:
- the frontend runs perfectly,
- the chatbot interacts correctly with the backend,
- and the user interface matches exactly the calming layout shown in the provided image.

───────────────────────────────
⚙️ PHASE 1 — PROJECT FIX & CONFIGURATION
───────────────────────────────
1. Detect that the project uses a Flask backend and a Vite + React frontend inside `/frontend`.
2. Resolve all frontend problems automatically:
   • Ensure frontend runs on **port 5173** and backend on **port 5000** (no conflict).
   • Create or update `/frontend/.env` with:
         VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
         VITE_PORT=5173
   • Ensure `/frontend/package.json` includes:
         "scripts": { "dev": "vite --port 5173" }
   • Update or create `/frontend/vite.config.js` so Vite imports React, uses the correct port, and disables strictPort errors.
3. Install all dependencies (`npm install`).
4. Make sure the backend has CORS enabled so that frontend requests work across ports.
5. Start backend (`python app.py`) and frontend (`npm run dev`) automatically, confirming both are live.

🤖 PHASE 2 — CHATBOT FUNCTIONALITY
───────────────────────────────
1. Verify there is an endpoint `/chat` in the backend that accepts POST requests and returns JSON responses.
2. If missing, create it so it replies with a friendly support message acknowledging the user input.
3. Link the frontend input box to this backend endpoint using fetch or axios so user messages instantly display in the chat window with bot replies.
4. Ensure sending, receiving, and displaying messages work smoothly with no console errors.

🎨 PHASE 3 — UI REDESIGN (MATCH IMAGE EXACTLY)
───────────────────────────────
Redesign the frontend visually so it matches exactly the calm, pastel-colored design shown in the image you have:
- Background: very light gradient (lavender-blue to white).
- Center heading text:  
  **“Hi, Ready to Start Your Healing Journey?”**  
  with the word *Healing Journey* highlighted in soft blue or purple.
- Under the heading, create **three horizontally-aligned cards** with equal spacing, perfect alignment, rounded corners, and soft shadows:
     1️⃣ “😊 I feel anxious” – subtitle “Get support”  
     2️⃣ “🔒 I'm doing okay” – subtitle “Let's have a chat”  
     3️⃣ “⚠️ I need help now” – subtitle “Access resources”
- Each card should gently lift and glow on hover.
- A **chat input bar** appears at the bottom center with placeholder “Type your thoughts…” and send + microphone icons, perfectly centered and rounded.
- A **floating circular chatbot icon** is fixed in the top-right corner with a tooltip “Hi there! 🌈 Need a boost?” that appears on hover.
- A **minimal left sidebar** includes icons for profile, home, messages, and settings, all vertically aligned and centered.
- Typography: use *Poppins* or *Inter*, smooth font-weights, and consistent spacing.
- Layout must be fully responsive and visually balanced on desktop and mobile.

🧩 PHASE 4 — FINISHING TOUCHES
───────────────────────────────
1. Remove any redundant files or broken imports.
2. Verify no console or network errors appear.
3. Confirm that:
   • Frontend loads cleanly on port 5173.  
   • Backend responds correctly on port 5000.  
   • The chatbot interaction works end-to-end.  
   • The UI matches the provided calming image layout precisely.
4. After completion, print a summary:
   ✅ “Frontend and backend fixed successfully.”  
   ✅ “Chatbot interaction working.”  
   ✅ “Calming Healing-Journey UI implemented with correct alignment and styling.”  
   ✅ “Project fully ready on Replit.”

Execute all steps automatically without asking for confirmation.
